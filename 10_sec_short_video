Perfect! I can create a **30-day plan of daily JavaScript & Python tips** for **short videos (15–30 seconds)**, including:

* **Hook (intro)**
* **Code snippet (before → after / demo)**
* **Humanized voiceover lines**
* **Outro (call to action)**

I’ll give you a sample for **Days 1–5** so you can see the format and tone. Each tip starts with **“JavaScript tip of the day”** or **“Python tip of the day”** in a friendly, engaging way.

---

### **Day 1 – JavaScript**

**Hook:**
“JavaScript tip of the day! 🚀 Did you know `===` and `==` are totally different?”

**Code Snippet (Before → After):**

```js
// Before
console.log(5 == '5'); // true
console.log(5 === '5'); // false

// After
console.log(5 == '5'); // loosely equal, true
console.log(5 === '5'); // strictly equal, false
```

**Voiceover Lines:**
“See here, `==` checks only value, but `===` checks value and type. Always prefer `===` for precise results.”

**Outro (CTA):**
“Try it in your console today! Hit like if this helped! 💻”

### **Day 2 – Python**

**Hook:**
“Python tip of the day! 🐍 Use list comprehensions to make your code cleaner!”

**Code Snippet (Before → After):**

```python
# Before
squares = []
for i in range(5):
    squares.append(i*i)

# After
squares = [i*i for i in range(5)]
```

**Voiceover Lines:**
“Instead of writing loops, list comprehensions make your code short and readable.”

**Outro (CTA):**
“Try it yourself and save lines of code! Don’t forget to share this tip!”

---

### **Day 3 – JavaScript**

**Hook:**
“JavaScript tip of the day! ✨ Want to swap two variables without a temp variable?”

**Code Snippet:**

```js
// Before
let a = 5, b = 10;
let temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;

// After
let a = 5, b = 10;
[a, b] = [b, a];
```

**Voiceover Lines:**
“Just use array destructuring—no temp variable needed! Clean and modern.”

**Outro (CTA):**
“Try this trick in your projects! Follow for more tips!”

### **Day 4 – Python**

**Hook:**
“Python tip of the day! 💡 Want to swap variables in one line?”

**Code Snippet:**

```python
# Before
a = 5
b = 10
temp = a
a = b
b = temp

# After
a, b = b, a
```

**Voiceover Lines:**
“Python makes swapping super easy with tuple unpacking. Short, simple, readable.”

**Outro (CTA):**
“Use this in your next project and impress your friends! 🐍”

---

### **Day 5 – JavaScript**

**Hook:**
“JavaScript tip of the day! 🔍 Quickly check if a variable is an array.”

**Code Snippet:**

```js
// Before
let arr = [1,2,3];
console.log(arr instanceof Array); // true

// After
console.log(Array.isArray(arr)); // true
```

**Voiceover Lines:**
“Instead of `instanceof`, use `Array.isArray()`—modern and more reliable.”

**Outro (CTA):**
“Check your variables in a snap! Follow for daily tips!”
